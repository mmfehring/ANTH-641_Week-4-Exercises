For the exercise with the Petra excavation trenches data set, all I did was merge the Contex(4) that were simple errors. I deliberatly left alone the files that were made deliberately different by the creator (i.e. "Trench 31" and "Trench 31 and Special Project 41").

The Label category threw me for a loop. How am I supposed to know if a backslash or dash is deliberate? Also, is there a way to exclude an option from a merge? For example if there is "Locus 6," "Locus  6," and "Locus 6?" can I exclude the last category so it doesn't get sucked into the merge? - Kevin answered me!! Individual text editing but luckily the change can be applied to all columns. I again went in and merged like files and when the above problem occured, I manually made those changes.
